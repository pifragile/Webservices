   The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the
   Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The
   elements are separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed
   except in the final CRLF sequence.

        Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF

	GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: 192.168.1.1:8080\r\n\r\n

	1. Chacheablility with the Cache-Conrtol field
	2. Layered System with e.g. Proxy-Authorization or Via

	Client: One can use the Socket class to connect to a server
		Socket s = New Socket(host,port);

	Server: One can use the ServerSocket class to accept incoming connections:
		ServerSocket s = new ServerSocket(port);
		s.accept();

2b.
	Blocking behavior means that the code waits for "something" to finish.
	For example, if a client sends a request to a server, and and the code
	only continues when it gets the answer, the code "waits" or "blocks".
	In InputStream read() is blocking. So if you want to read 8 bytes
	the InputStream blocks until all 8 bytes are ready. To avoid blocking
	one can use the available() method which states how many bytes can be read
	without blocking.
	In output stream flush() is blocking which immediately writes out all
	buffered bytes.

	false -  REST is not a protocol but rather an architectural style

3b.
	false - exactly the opposite

3c.
	true

3d. false - json is one possible data representation among many other from 
	which the client can chose

	Each instance of the emulator runs behind a virtual router/firewall service 
	that isolates it from your development machine network interfaces and settings 
	and from the internet. An emulated device can't see your development machine or 
	other emulator instances on the network. Instead, it sees only that it is connected 
	through Ethernet to a router/firewall.

5b.
	127.0.0.1 refers to the device on which the code is running, in this case the emulator.

5c.
	10.0.2.2

5d.
	To communicate with an emulator instance behind its virtual router, you need to set up 
	network redirection on the virtual router.
